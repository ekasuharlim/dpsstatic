			  <p>The SFC Asia platform will only fund sustainable projects that fall within the following sustainability themes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
					<h3>Circular economy</h3>
					<p>
						As the world’s consumption increases with population, our Earth’s resources will not be able to sustain the “take, Make, Dispose” model in its current form. 
						There is growing imperative for the circular model which is restorative and regenerative by design, keeping the highest utility and value at all times. 
						Circular business models often include circular supplies and supply chains, product life extension, resource productivity and sharing of products or product as a service. 
						Some examples of proposals may include projects that fundamentally change your supply chain from linear model to circular i.e. by building recycling plants next to manufacturing basis 
						or projects that improve resource usage i.e. retrofitting of buildings.
					</p>
				</li>
                <li>
					<h3>Sustainable energy</h3>
					<p>
						Sustainable energy or renewable energy and energy efficiency forms a critical part of reducing GHG emissions and decreasing water footprint. 
						This is crucial in addressing the fundamental energy challenges we face today. 
						Investments in this area have accelerated due to growing price competitiveness in the whole value chain, 
						as well as long-term certainty by policy measures and tariff support. 
						Some examples of proposals may include any type of renewable energy projects or energy efficiency projects.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Social Impact</h3>
					<p>
						Social impact projects generate measurable social and environmental impact mainly in emerging markets. 
						These projects aim to bring about positive meaningful changes to communities and the well-being of the individuals and families. 
						Some examples of proposals may include projects that promote financial inclusion, health and wellness, minority empowerment and access to education and electricity.
